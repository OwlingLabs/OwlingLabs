# Owling Protocol 🦉

Owling Protocol brings a new way to collect user information, rewarding the best and the most viral creators and contributors and working in a simple way: Creators upload forms with the theme they want “What kind of bear market are you”, “What kind of Owl are you”, “What Cryptocurrency are you”, with their respective results and created images for each result. Users called Submitters fill out the form and accumulate a certain form points amount, the result will be calculated by the smart contract and displayed at the end of the process, allowing the submitter to share and mint their NFT. The data provided will be stored in the smart contract and also in a node in The Graph Protocol for helping the data query
